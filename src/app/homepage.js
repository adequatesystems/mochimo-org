            In addition, here are some of the novel innovations that set

          </Grid>
          <Grid item xs={12} sm={10} md={8}>
          <HomepageAccordion {...{ active, handleChange, panel: 'crunch' }}>

              >ChainCrunchâ„¢ Compression
              </HomepageAccordianSummary>
              <AccordionDetails>
                With the size of many blockchains growing uncontrollably, and
                some already exceeding 1TB in size, scalability still remains a
                priority issue. Mochimo uses a proprietary compression algorithm
                called ChainCrunchâ„¢, which solves this issue without compromising
                on blockchain integrity.
                <br /><br />
                At almost 4 years of age and more than 670k blocks, the
                core component used to verify the integrity of the Blockchain is
                a mere 50MB in size. A full node need only download an additional
                and tiny, compressed portion of the historical blockchain and
                begin contributing to the network immediately.
              </AccordionDetails>

            <HomepageAccordion {...{ active, handleChange, panel: 'pseudo' }}>

              >Pseudo-block Failsafe
              </HomepageAccordianSummary>
              <AccordionDetails>
                What happens when a large portion power suddenly disappears from
                the network? With the remaining power left to solve tremendously
                high difficulties in order to clear transactions, how long should
                you wait? Days? WEEKS? MoNtHs? Not around these parts...
                <br /><br />
                The Mochimo network detects long block times and agrees to lower
                the difficulty with a special kind of block. The "pseudo-block".
                With the power of friendship (and of course, a little "pseudo"
                blockchain magic), the Mochimo network restores normal clearing
                times to transactions within hours of a 90% mining power loss.

                ... and now there are hundreds of thousands of Haiku baked into
                each and every single block. Not only are they great to look at,
                it is a requirement of blockchain validity that the nonce used
                to solve a block originates from a syntactically correct Haiku.

              <AccordionDetails>
                Address size is one of the major hurdles with Quantum Resistant
                public keys. At 2208 bytes, it's
                more than a handful to remember or to share. Fortunately, Mochimo deploys 
                a custom tagging feature that automatically generates an address from the very 
                first quantum resistant public key ever used. This address will never change, 
                even if the public keys change.
                This allows enormous public keys to be "tagged" with a short and easily memorable address
                of a mere 20 bytes in length. The official way of sharing these 20 bytes follows the Bitcoin standard 
                of using base58, and including a crc16 checksum at the end.

              <AccordionDetails>
                Dubbed "The Peach Algorithm", Mochimo uses a unique "FPGA-Tough"
                Proof of Work mining algorithm, that is specifically designed to
                shift the value of mining in favor of miners with Gaming GPUs.
                <br /><br />
                The Peach algorithm a standard arrangement of hashing algorithms,
                memory transformations, and deterministic FLOPs as the first layer
                of "FPGA Tough"-ness. This layer is further supported by a minimum
                VRAM requirement that gives a considerable "mining advantage" to
                hardware (notably GPUs) with the ability to cache a large sparse
                matrix of pre-computed data unique to each block.
                <br /><br />
                Ultimately, the few FPGAs with access to this "mining advantage"
                are likely to be eclipsed by Gaming GPUs in terms of value.

              What's the supply statistics?
            </Typography>
            Mochimo's supply is fairly simply split into 2 categories.
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Instamine Supply (<Amount value='4757066000000000' />)
                </strong><br />
                The Instamine (not to be confused with a "premine") existed
                as a single ledger entry of Mochimo's Genesis Block. This
                instamine was split into it's predetermined allocations
                during the early days of the Blockchain.<br /><br />
                <Address href short wots={remainingInstamine} /> currently
                holds the largest remainder of the instamine, which is
                controlled by the Mochimo Foundation, and is LOCKED by
                contractual agreement until 25th June 2023.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>

                    /* realtime "max supply" minus "instamine" */
                    <Amount value={((chain.data?.maxsupply || 76493180.0616804) * 1e+9) - 4757066000000000} />
                  )})
                </strong><br />
                The Mineable supply can be described simply as Mochimo
                that is rewarded to a "miner" for solving a block on the
                Blockchain. The distribution of these rewards over the
                life of the Mochimo Blockchain is explained and illustrated

              How is the Instamine used?
            </Typography>
            The majority of the Instamine was allocated to the original
            Mochimo Development Team. The team spent years creating a
            cryptocurrency platform that solves almost every major issue
            with Bitcoin to date. Therefore, this allocation serves as a
            fee (in MCM) for that work. The fee is equal to approximately
            4.46% of the fully diluted Mochimo supply.

            No. Somewhat importantly, performing a transaction on the
            Mochimo Network DOES NOT require access to the blockchain.
            This allows Wallets, Exchanges, Third-Party Applications and

            We checked out the algorithms that were peer reviewed and
            acknowledged by the EU backed Quantum Research group PQCRYPTO
            and chose the WOTS+ algorithm. We then wrote and vetted our
            quantum code with the algorithm's originator: Andreas HÃ¼lsing.
            The penalty of adopting quantum signatures is their size, but
            we've already solved that problem with our ChainCrunchâ„¢ tech.
